# VisionMol 1.0.0 public release

VisionMol is a protein molecule visualization app specifically designed for VR. It allows users to visually view and manipulate structural models of biological macromolecules such as proteins in an immersive 3D virtual environment.

## VisionMol 1.0 Features

1. **Multi-molecular loading**
- Supports simultaneous loading of multiple PDB format molecular files into VR scenes.

2. **Molecular representation**
- Supports a variety of classical molecular representations, such as wireframes, sticks, ball molds, surfaces and protein cartoons.
- Support advanced Hyperball representation to provide smooth visual effects.

3. **Measurement function**
- Supports measurement of the distance between any two atoms in a molecule.

4. **Molecular splicing**
- Support for combining multiple molecular models into one overall model.

5. **Molecular tags**
- Support for showing or hiding individual atom labels in 3D molecular models.

6. **Virtual Reality interaction**
- Supports natural 3D interaction through VR gamepads, such as panning, rotating and zooming.

7. **Residue color segmentation display**
- The molecular model can be divided into different color blocks according to residues for display.

8. **Secondary structure color adjustment**
- The color display of protein secondary structures (α-helix, β-fold, etc.) can be customized.

## Requirements

- VisionMol is based on game engine Unity.
- This version runs on Unity 2021.3.34f1c1 LTS, tested on Windows. The main development is done on Windows.

## How to use

1. Open the project with Unity 2021.3.34f1c1.
2. 'MainScene.unity' is the main scene file.
3. Load the required PDB molecular file from the menu.
4. Use VR gamepad for 3D interaction, viewing and operating molecular models.
5. Switch the visual representation of molecules, measure distance, merge molecules, adjust residue color segmentation and secondary structure color and other functions through the interface menu.

## Precautions

- Using VisionMol requires configuring the appropriate virtual reality hardware.
- For different operating systems, users may need to install specific runtimes or drivers.
- High performance computer hardware is recommended for a smooth VR experience.
