About VisionMol:

VisionMol is a virtual reality tool developed using the Unity game engine and the C# programming language. This tool can vividly present the three-dimensional structure of molecules in a virtual environment and supports real-time operation and interaction for users. Users can rotate, zoom in, zoom out, and move molecules, as well as perform various structural adjustments and analysis operations using gestures, controllers, or other input devices. Additionally, the tool provides a rich visualization and interaction interface, helping users intuitively understand the intermolecular interactions and chemical properties. The real-time interaction effects and intuitive visualization enable users to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between molecular structure and properties, thereby accelerating research progress and promoting scientific discoveries. This virtual reality-based protein molecular analysis tool has important applications in biomedical research, life science education, drug design and optimization, biotechnology, and engineering applications.

Users can perform the following operations using VisionMol:

1.Simultaneously load multiple molecular files in PDB format into the VR scene.  
2.Switch between various classic molecular representation modes, such as wireframe, ball-and-stick, stick, surface, and protein cartoon, among others.  
3.Measure the distance between any two atoms in the molecule.  
4.Merge multiple molecular models into a single integrated model.  
5.Display or hide the labels of individual atoms in the 3D molecular model.  
Display the molecular model with different color blocks based on residues.  
Customize the color display of protein secondary structures (α-helices, β-sheets, etc.).  
Perform natural three-dimensional interactions, such as translation, rotation, and scaling, using VR controllers.
