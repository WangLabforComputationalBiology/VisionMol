Documentation of Courtroom Interior Kit

In this package, we have created all the models separately, all the models are reuseable and 
it depends upon us that how we can use and place them in the scene.

We have created multiple props for this scene. You can create your own scene by using these props.

Models are made with Materials. The Courtroom Interior Kit consists of different objects created individually,
so you can use them to create an intuitive and eye-catching user interface for your 3D game or animated video. 
The vectors can be edited and placed at any scene in the game/video to give it a more defined look.
